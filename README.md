# TheGreatRobberyGame
Game made as the last assignment for the intermeate section of Sandor Szekeres' Udemy course: Java Course with Practical Examples for Absolute Beginners

In this game, you play as a criminal trying to rob valuables from several locations. At the same time, a detective is trying to get you, every turn they will search a random location to try and find you. You can attempt as many robberies as you want, but if you get caught, it's GAME OVER for you! Each player turn, he's gonna be somewhere at random trying to get you, if he is at the same place as you, things could become even more difficult. Each round, you choose a valid command for information or a place to take a item at random or yet, if you had you enough, you may choose to cut and run! There being any other players left in play, they go on for as long as they desire or are able to. But be careful pushing you luck, as the rounds progress, the detective chances at getting if you are at the same place becom increasingly higher, as well as the security for each location.
So, you know... do it at your own risk. When all the players have either escaped or been arrested, the total value of their loot is counted, if the detective recovered more than all the criminals managed to get away with, they win, otherwise the player with the most valuable haul does.
